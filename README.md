# Error-based-Filtering-EBF-

This is the code for the paper: Error-Based Noise Filtering During Neural Network Training https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9178278

EBF is a method which is used as a dynamic noise filtering technique during neural netowrks training.



All code was developed and tested by keras; and implemented on AWS GPU. The environment is as bellow:

TensorFlow and Keras 2
Python 2.7
CUDA 9.0
numpy 1.16.5

For running the method, simply run the file model.py which is developed for MNIST dataset.
To implement the method for different dataset or differetn model architecture, just change the code in model.py file.

In case of any issue, I am glad to take any enquiry.
